# Study with me with this

Implementing Pomodoro study method. A toy project to practice asynchronous programming in Python.

Written in Python 3.10. qasync~=0.23.0 is strictly required: a higher version doesn't work.

Optional camera function. Aiming to use computer vision to measure *actual study time*, eventually.
